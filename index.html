                            <p class="intro">&emsp;&emsp;Iâ€™ve known to be very meticulous by many, some say that I am a perfectionist,
                                some say Iâ€™m a hypocrite of some sort. But what if there was no concrete thing
                                that we truly are, I mean we are human beings, why limit ourselves to only one
                                pronoun? We could be more than what people see from us, some already have this
                                type of mentality, but some still to contradict certain possibilities.</p>
                            <p class="intro">&emsp;&emsp;For example, people way back then never thought that it was okay to be gay. 
                                People condemned them for their outrageous claim that they are attracted 
                                to the same sex, or what not. To be honest, I really donâ€™t know what 
                                Iâ€™m talking about here, I just wanted to try to import this to my html 
                                file, you know, exploring, maybe Iâ€™ll try making an autobiography out of 
                                this. Yeah, lets do that!</p>
                            <p class="intro">&emsp;&emsp;So my name is JOSHUA RYLE ZAMAYLA BRACHO, I currently reside in Manolo Fortich 
                                Bukidnon at the house of my grandparents. Why am I not with my mother, well, long 
                                story short, I am here to take care of my grandparents, even though this doesnâ€™t 
                                seem to be the case, they still made me do it. I didnâ€™t hesitate to leave the 
                                house because I really didnâ€™t quite enjoy the company with my mom, she is really 
                                a handful when sheâ€™s drunk, let alone mad. As for my father, wellâ€¦. He doesnâ€™t 
                                have the means to raise me, thus I didnâ€™t want to grow up in his household. To 
                                be really honest, my family is messed up, my mom and dad still have this big 
                                fuss and itâ€™s really annoying, I mean, canâ€™t we all just get along and live put 
                                our lives? Theyâ€™re supposed to be grown ups but, whatever, thatâ€™s it for my 
                                autobiography, end sceneâ€¦.</p>
