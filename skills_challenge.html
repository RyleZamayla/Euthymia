                <article><h1>COLLEGE &nbsp||&nbsp USTP<hr></h1>
                    <p>The University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP) is a state university established on August 16, 2016 by virtue of Republic Act 10919 through the amalgamation of the Mindanao University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental and the Misamis Oriental State College of Agriculture and Technology (MOSCAT) in Claveria, Misamis Oriental.

                <article><h1>EDITORIAL &nbsp||&nbsp Cartooning and Writting<hr></h1>
                    <p>An editorial is a journalistic writing that aims to either enlighten or explain, persuade or convince, or stimulate thought in a fun or amusing way. The editorial may have an introduction, a body, and a conclusion, much like an essay. It may use exposition, narrative, description, or reasoning in its different forms of composition. Many of the traits associated to essays are seen in many of the definitions explored here.</p>
    
                    <p>The word "We" is used in the editorial because it is assumed that it reflects management policy. The listener is supposed to perceive the anonymous first-person plural as representing the media, not the person who created it.Editorial cartoons in newspapers are visual representations of their creator's thoughts and beliefs. Because editorial cartoons are a business, editors and/or management may have an influence on what is published. Editorial cartoons are often published in a mass media like a newspaper, news magazine, or the Internet.</p>
